# PacmanGame
My first game in C++: Pacman!

Use the arrow keys to move Pacman, and avoid the ghosts. Its about as simple as that.

Note:

The game has two known bugs, and two known lacking features:

Bugs:
- Every once in a while, the ghosts get "stuck". This is resolved when a powerup is eaten or a new round begins (e.g. Pacman's death).
- Very rarely, the ghosts "jump" across a wall. This can crash the game if they move outside of the windowed area.

Features to include:
- This game has one level that does not end until Pacman dies. Ideally, there would be more levels with changing difficulty per level.
- The music is not on repeat, so the game feels quite silent after about 3.5 min. This can be resolved easily using features already included in the Chili framework.



Features that were purposely not included:
- I've kept the AI relatively simple given that this is my first game attempt. Therefore, I did not allow for the ghosts to return to base, etc.


Otherwise, I hope you enjoy this simplified version of Pacman!
